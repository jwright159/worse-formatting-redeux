#Worse Formatting Redeux

A BetterDiscord plugin to replace text you send via regex replacement a la Pesterchum for typing quirks.
By default requires you to put ++ before and after text you want to replace, but that's also controlled by an editable regex.
Comes with 7 regex slots but easily adjustable in the plugin code.
